##flask-apps

this gives flask applications a setting similar to djangos `INSTALLED_APPS`,
called `INSTALLED_BLUEPRINTS`

- to use:
    - in your settings file add:
```
INSTALLED_BLUEPRINTS = [
    'path.to.the.bp',
    'path.to.next.bp'
]
```

    - then when you create your app do
```
from flask_apps import FlaskApps

app = Flask(__name__)

flask_apps = FlaskApps(app)

```

And thats it, from there FlaskApps will import and register all of the blueprints from the `INSTALLED_BLUEPRINTS` setting, as well as any modules inside the blueprints, ie: models, views, filters, anything
